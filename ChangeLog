2005-08-19 Jörg Lehmann  <joerg@luga.de>

	* Get rid of multi-file database layout:
	   - convert old layout automatically
	   - leave configuration file switches basename and dbfile intact but
	     warn the user when they are non-empty
	   - in a next step, we will set the default value of the basename
	     switch to an empty value (when presumably all databases have been
	     converted)
	   - finally as a final step, we remove the switches and require
	     that the users change their config files
	* Database version 5: do not longer index by years but by decades
	which removes many special code paths at various places in the db
	code.


2005-08-11 Jörg Lehmann  <joerg@luga.de>

	* bufferedao.c: New C extension module corresponding to

	latter module.

2005-01-23 Jörg Lehmann  <joerg@luga.de>

	* services/songdb.py: Do not sort the intermediate results when
	querying multiple databases. While this yields an improved caching

	* Add French translation (many thanks to Nicolas Évrard
	<nicoe at altern dot org>).

	source in the song.

	* Allow the user to filter songs by their rating (as suggested by
	Thomas Klein-Hitpass <thomas at projekt-barrierefrei dot de>).

	* Database version 4.


2004-07-22 Jörg Lehmann  <joerg@luga.de>

	* Version 2.0.14 released.

	* Make player progress bar more readable on mono devices (thanks
	to Krzysztof Zych <kzych at manta dot univ dot gda dot pl>).

	net> for providing me with the update). Included is a patch which
	should fix the length detection for VBR MP3 files (hopefully

	single file.


2004-04-22  Jörg Lehmann  <joerg@luga.de>

	this problem).

	* pytonectl.py: Rewrite to allow for requests and not only events.

	* pytonectl.py: Add getplayerinfo function, which prints a string

	crossfading in [players.*] sections, which allows the user to turn
	off the crossfading of songs (suggested by Niels Drost <ndrost@cs
	dot vu dot nl>).

	* services/songdbs/local.py: Store playing time with each song
	in lastplayed list to later on permit merging of lists coming
	from different databases. Upon upgrade, the last played song
	list will be deleted!

	configuration file at module initialisation time, in order to be
	usable for pytonectl as well (fixing a problem reported by Han
	Boetes <han at mijncomputer dot nl>).

	* services/player.py: autoplay now also works after having
	stopped and restarted the player manually (thanks to Han Boetes
	for pointing me to this long standing annoyance).

	* events.py: New event playertogglepause which allows to pause the
	player, if it is playing, or start playing, if it is paused.

	eventually have to add a configuration variable for that.


2003-07-19 Jörg Lehmann  <joerg@luga.de>

	* Fix missing os.path.expanduser around config file path
	(thanks to David Braaten <xiticix47 at hotmail.com>)


2003-07-18 Jörg Lehmann  <joerg@luga.de>

	* Version 2.0.0 finally released.


2003-06-08 Jörg Lehmann  <joerg@luga.de>

	* Support default background color and try to use
	curses.use_default_colors, if present. This requires
	a new version of the Python curses module.

	* Support ossaudiodev instead of ao interface. Unfortunately,
	this doesn't work well with the current ossaudiodev module
	of Python 2.3beta1. On the other hand, I was not able
	to run the ao module with a debug build of current Python
	CVS. Probably, ao is buggy.

	* helpwin.py: Set self.items already in constructor, to
	prevent possible crash, if one presses a key during

	* MP3Info.py: change _strip_zero function to
	  - use faster lstrip, if Python 2.2.2 and above
	  - cut string after first (non-leading) \0 character,
	    thereby fixing PyTone crashes reported by a few
	    users.

	* slist.py: Fix bug in selectbysearchstring and selectbyletter,
	reported by John Plevyak <jplevyak at acm.org>.


2003-05-06  Jörg Lehmann  <joerg@luga.de>

	* mainscreen.py: Catch curses.curs_set exception (reported
	by roland at steeltorch.com.


2003-05-05  Jörg Lehmann  <joerg@luga.de>

	* More database work and tests. Genres now contain indices
	to albums and songs

	* album -> albumid at appropriate places

	* introduced song.id, but not yet used


2003-05-01  Jörg Lehmann  <joerg@luga.de>

	* Integrated and polished some patches by Iñigo Serna
	<inigoserna at telefonica.net>: Currently playing song gets different colour and
	stays centred in playlist. Furthermore, some sanity checks of the id3 tags
	have been included. Finally, as suggested by him, a much nicer scrollbar
	has been implemented.

	* Support ossaudiodev module (and old oss module , of course) as
	suggested by Bill Kearney <wkearney99 at hotmail.com>.

	* Many fixes for bugs remaining from code restructuring.


2003-04-19  Jörg Lehmann  <joerg@luga.de>

	* New configuration system is complete now.


2003-04-18  Jörg Lehmann  <joerg@luga.de>

	* Massive rework of configuration file handling.

	* Network connectivity now via TCP instead of XML-RPC.


2003-04-13  Jörg Lehmann  <joerg@luga.de>

	* Reworked config file as first step versus a
	new config syntax. Import of the curses module
	is no longer necessary (except for the check
	whether the user has a color or a mono terminal,
	which often doesn't work, so ...)

	* Colors now have to be specified like in mutt
	"color foreground background" or "mono attribute".
	Foreground may contain the prefix "bright".

	* Accept command line options for debugging output
	and network functionality.

	* Implement first rough cut of network functionality
	via xmlrpc. Remote access to the database is now
	possible.

	depending on rating upon random song insertion.


2003-01-13  Jörg Lehmann  <joerg@luga.de>

	* Implement random recursive insert. Reserve key "r" for
	this function, giving up the old behaviour.


2003-01-12  Jörg Lehmann  <joerg@luga.de>

	* config.py: New option autoregisterer, which allows to
	enable/disbale the song automatic searching for songs
	and playlists after the start of PyTone.

	* builddb.py: Manually populate song and playlist
	database.


2003-01-09  Jörg Lehmann  <joerg@luga.de>

	<penguinista at mail.net.mk> for pointing this out.


2002-12-22  Jörg Lehmann  <joerg@luga.de>

	* Use MP3Info.py from http://www.omniscia.org/~vivake/python

2002-12-15  Jörg Lehmann  <joerg@luga.de>

	* Implement genre list: New database schema, permitting efficient
	search for items belonging to a given genre. New items: genres,
